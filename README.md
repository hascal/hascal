## Why use Hascal ?

Hascal is so powerful and we listed its important features above.
you can see that Hascal is perfect in front of many, many other well-known programming languages.
Also, We have tested many programming languages for Hascal's Back-End, including: C, C++, Assembly, GoLang, Rust, Pascal, and DLang.
DLang was the best and as you can see, we have used it for our purpose.

## Example
```dart
print("what is your name ?");
var name = ReadStr();
print("Hello ,",name);
```
You can see more Hascal examples [here](https://github.com/hascal/hascal/tree/main/examples).
